# newEggAutoBuyer

This project was made to try to buy a graphics card for my computer build.

It's a basic python script that goes through a website and clicks and refreshes the page as needed until the product is available, and completes the purchase transaction for you. Graphics card drops occur so sporatically, and I did not want to sit around refreshing the screen all day, so the purpose of this python script is to watch for when a product is available, and to purchase it automatically.

Note: This has no intentions of scalping or buying large amounts of a product in order to resell for a higher price. It was created merely for learning purposes and to compete with the scalping bots in hopes of getting just one graphics card as a consumer during this silicon chip shortage.
