This project was made to try to buy a graphics card for my computer build. This has no intentions of scalping or buying large amounts of a product in order to resell for a higher price. It was created merely for learning purposes and to compete with the scalping bots in hopes if getting just one graphics card as a consumer during this silicon chip shortage.
